This project is related to code used for the Advanced Security project "__Cyber Attack Detection thanks to Machine Learning Algorithms__". This work has been carried out by Antoine Delplace, Sheryl Hermoso, and Kristofer Anandita.
## Perpose
The aim of this project was to use various machine learning algorithms on the Netflow database to detect cyberattacks. As a result six algorithms were tested. 
## Methods
The project was performed on Google Collaborator. All Python modules were included within the ide. To repeat this in google colaberator the
